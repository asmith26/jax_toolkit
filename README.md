A collection of jax functions to help with common machine/deep learning related functionality. 

[Documentation](https://asmith26.github.io/jax_toolkit/), [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/jax-toolkit/)

This library currently contains the basics for a number of losses and metrics. We intend to add more complexity and functionality as and when it's needed - of course contributions/pull requests/bug reports etc. are very welcome if you discover problems or need something that is currently missing.
